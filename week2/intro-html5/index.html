                <h3>Brief Prose on the Magic of Derby</h3>
                <p>
                    Roller Derby is a powerful sport for powerful women. Not for the faint of heart, this sport calls upon the strength of those who would otherwise have very few outlets to release all of the tension of everyday life. Roller Derby brings together individuals from every walk of life. It is a celebration of diversity. 
                    It creates strong and positive role models for young girls by allowing women to express themselves, free from judgment and prejudice. That being said, Roller Derby is for everyone. There are plenty of Co-ed opportunties, bringing guys in on the fun as well. 
                    However, this game will always have a special place in women's hearts everywhere, until the whistle sounds, and the jam is over.
