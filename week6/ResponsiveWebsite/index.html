                <h3>How I Budget Travel</h3>
                <p>Save, save, save! I am a chronic saver and proud cheapskate! This has had a huge impact on my travel capabilities. By living well below my means, I am able to have many one in a life time experiences that most people only dream of. Here are a few steps that can help you.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spend as little as possible. This seems like a given, but you'd be surprised at how much people DON'T shop around for the best bargain. $2 shampoo vs. $10 shampoo. The everyday expenses are the ones that added up the quickest, and ultimately hurt our savings goals the most.</li>
                    <li>Find jobs that you can do while traveling. Not all travel has to be a big money blowout session. Maybe find a six-month teaching contract where you're given room & board and a small salary. This not only helps you MAKE money while traveling, but gives you an entirely new cultural experience.</li>
                    <li>Visit low-budget travel destinations. Believe me, I would love to visit Paris non-stop just like anybody else, but it's fair to say top european destinations like this are not easy on the pocket. Try to visit some lesser known parts of the globe. Who knows? The less money you spend might actually gain you a richer experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These helpful tips are by no means law. They're are just some things I see many people overlook or struggle with. These three simple steps have gained me so many new opportunities that I would not have had otherwise.</p>
