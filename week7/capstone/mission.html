            <p>Here at Colorful Heart VG, we strive to give back to our community. Our top priority is quality of human life. We help give talented and hard-working members of the community opportunities to demonstrate how much they care! We value every kind of skill here. Are you good with numbers? Help us keep the books! Are you a handyman? We can always use someone to teach us how to better assist our neighbors! This is an organization that fosters community growth and unity.</p><br>
